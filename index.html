        <h2>Twellio EOL</h2>
        <p>As they say, all good things must be replaced by superior technology. Or something like that.</p>

        <p>Twellio has now been shut down. I hope you have found it useful these past few years.</p>

        <p>If you are a current subscriber, you should have received an email with more info. If you were looking to sign up, fear not! <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> is coming to the rescue. I have created a recipe to duplicate Twellio's functionality with their new Trello integration. You can find the link below.</p>
